Thousands of people with billions of pageviews have already used our GA importer to bring the UA and GA4 data into Fathom Analytics.<\/p>\n<p>The process is simple:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect your Google Analytics account to your Fathom account. This works for Universal Analytics and GA4 properties<\/li>\n<li>Create a new import with a single GA site or several GA sites<\/li>\n<li>Select a date range you wish to import<\/li>\n<li>Click \u201cimport\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That\u2019s it.
