we\u2019ll show you everything you need to know about unique users visiting your site right in this guide.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-unique-visitors\">What Are Unique Visitors?<\/h2>\n<p>Unique visitors are defined as <strong>the number of unduplicated individual users who visit your website over the course of a specified time period.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google Analytics unique visitors are one of the most important web analytics metrics and shows you insights regarding the <strong>growth and evolution<\/strong> of your site\u2019s audience.<\/p>\n<p>An increase in the total number of unique visitors means that your site is <strong>being accessed by new people<\/strong> over a certain time period.<\/p>\n<p>This information can be used to determine the engagement of your site content, the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and user behaviour based on traffic sources.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"official-google-analytics-definition-of-unique-visitors\">Official Google Analytics Definition of Unique Visitors<\/h3>\n<p>Google defines unique visitors as the <strong>\u201ctotal number of unique users who logged an event.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Back in Universal Analytics (compare UA to GA4 metrics here), the \u201cTotal Number of Users\u201d metric was measured as a whole based on unique sessions (users that had at least <em>one session<\/em> within the selected date range).<\/p>\n<p>In GA4, user visits can only be <strong>considered \u201cunique\u201d<\/strong> if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A first-party cookie is stored on the user\u2019s browser.<\/li>\n<li>They trigger an engaged session event (stay on a web page for 10 seconds or more, visit another page, or trigger a conversion event).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-google-analytics-identify-unique-visitors\">How Does Google Analytics Identify Unique Visitors?<\/h2>\n<p>Google Analytics 4 determines unique visits by storing browser cookies when they open a session on your website.<\/p>\n<p>GA4 cookies store a client ID in <strong>a first-party cookie called _ga.<\/strong> This cookie assigns an identifier to the new session, which helps the tool <em>distinguish<\/em> between a new user and a returning visitor.<\/p>\n<p>Although the <strong>default expiration time of the ga cookie is 2 years<\/strong>, it is possible for web owners to change these parameters in order to <strong>comply with privacy regulations<\/strong> imposed by government authorities.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that some browsers, such as Safari, enforce <strong>limitations on the lifespan of cookies<\/strong> if users do not return to a certain website.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"unique-visitors-vs-new-users\">Unique Visitors vs New Users<\/h3>\n<p>Google Analytics 4 allows you to track unique visitors to your website through cookies, but <strong>what if one user comes back?<\/strong> Will they be tracked as a unique visitor?<\/p>\n<p>No, as long as the first-party cookie with its unique identifier is <em>still stored<\/em> on their browser.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New users in Google Analytics 4 are the total number of users who launch or open your website for the first time.<\/strong> In order to classify website visitors as unique users, GA4 takes the following factors into account:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user need to have <strong>a new unique user ID<\/strong> stored through cookies.<\/li>\n<li>A <strong>first_visit or first_open event<\/strong> needs to be triggered.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Both conditions must be met in order to count users as new visitors.<\/p>\n<p>If, for instance, a user triggers a first_open event, but their user ID has been already stored by GA4 in the past, they will be counted as a <strong>returning user.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"limitations-of-unique-visitors-data-in-ga\">Limitations of Unique Visitors Data in GA<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s way of measuring unique visitors is <strong>not perfect.<\/strong> Returning users can be counted as unique visitors sometimes, which causes <strong>inaccurate data reporting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the following scenarios, Google Analytics 4 will encounter <em>anomalies<\/em> while trying to measure unique visitors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ad-blockers and privacy-focused browsers:<\/strong> visitors who employ ad-blockers and different browsers with privacy-focused features will not appear as Unique Users in your GA4 dashboard. Fathom Analytics is a Google Analytics alternative that is blocked by less ad-blockers and browsers than GA.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cross-device cookie tracking:<\/strong> if the same user accesses your website through multiple devices or a different operating system, it will be counted as a new unique visitor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multiple individuals using the same device:<\/strong> if more than one person uses a single device to see your website, they will count as a single person towards the Unique Visitors web metric.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Incognito browsing modes contribute to inaccuracies:<\/strong> Incognito Browsing Modes, such as Google Chrome Incognito Mode, causes users to be seen as new users, even if they are returning visitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Local laws\/regulations that make data collection limited:<\/strong> privacy regulations in some countries establish that websites can only store cookies if users give their consent. Google Analytics 4 has a cookie Consent Mode, which provides users with the option to get their user sessions tracked by cookies or not.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-find-unique-visitors-in-google-analytics-4\">Where to Find Unique Visitors in Google Analytics 4<\/h2>\n<p>You can see how many unique visitors your site gets simply by logging into your Google Analytics account.<\/p>\n<p>After you log in to Google Analytics account, go to the main <strong>Home Tab.<\/strong> There, you will see a graphic that shows you both <strong>Users and New Users.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cUsers\u201d refers to each unique visitor<\/strong> your website has obtained during the past few days.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you can <strong>change the date range<\/strong> of the graphic to get monthly, weekly or daily insights into the Unique Visitor metric.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tracktrendyv2.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/unique-visitors-google-analytics-4-view-usefathom.com_.jpg\" alt=\"unique visitors in ga4\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have recently made the switch from UA to GA4, remember that the tools do not track unique visitors equally, <strong>even if the term \u201cUsers\u201d appear the same.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>GA4 tracks unique visitors based on events, whereas UA tracks unique visitors based on sessions.<\/p>\n<p>This is all you need know about unique visitors concepts and definitions in Google Analytics 4. Keep in mind that unique visitor metrics should be <strong>analyzed, interpreted and checked based on your own website\u2019s audience and goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"are-unique-visitors-same-as-unique-pageviews\">Are Unique Visitors Same as Unique Pageviews?<\/h3>\n<p>No, unique visitors and unique pageviews are not the same. Unique pageviews are the <strong>number of times that certain web pages have been viewed by a unique visitor<\/strong> over a certain time period. This means that if a unique visitor sees 3 different pages, Google Analytics 4 will count it as 3 page views, but only a single Unique Page View.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>Paul Jarvis is the co-founder of Fathom Analytics and the co-host of the Above Board podcast.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>Posted in learn<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"wpss_copy\">Content retrieved from: <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/blog\/unique-visitors-google-analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/usefathom.com\/blog\/unique-visitors-google-analytics<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fathom Analytics blog \/ Learn Unique Visitors in Google Analytics: All You Need To Know Learn everything about unique visitors in Google Analytics 4, including their definition, identification, limitations, and where to find the data. &nbsp; Google Analytics 4 measures website visitors differently than Universal Analytics.
