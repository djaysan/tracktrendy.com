Moving from UA to GA4 is now necessary for all users, and although not all of us are on board with this decision, Google leaves many no alternative.<\/p>\n<p>Well, perhaps there is one alternative: learn <strong>how to delete Google Analytics account<\/strong>, and say goodbye to all the headaches related to Google Analytics tools.<\/p>\n<p>This guide will show you precisely that, and worry not &#8211; you can always use Fathom Analytics Google Analytics Importer to have a fresh, private, and safe start once again.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"3-common-google-analytics-deletion-questions-and-answers\">3 Common Google Analytics Deletion Questions and Answers<\/h2>\n<p>Google Analytics has been <strong>widely criticized for the way it handles user data<\/strong> within its tool.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, common Google Analytics problems can pop up from time to time (such as when Google Analytics not showing data), and it is up to us to <em>address these issues.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you want to <strong>delete your entire Google Analytics account<\/strong>, you need to be aware of a few details.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"1-what-happens-when-i-delete-my-google-analytics-account\">1. What Happens When I Delete My Google Analytics Account?<\/h3>\n<p>When you delete a Google Analytics account, all the information and historical data stored on the account will be <strong>permanently deleted 35 days<\/strong> after the initial deletion date.<\/p>\n<p>This means that data streams, users, website information, traffic insights, and all the properties related to that Google Analytics account will <strong>completely disappear after 35 days<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If more than 35 days pass and you want to restore a certain account, note that your old data will be gone, but you can open a new GA4 account and start from scratch.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"2-can-i-restore-a-deleted-google-analytics-account\">2. Can I Restore a Deleted Google Analytics Account?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes &#8211; you can <strong>entirely restore a deleted Google Analytics<\/strong> account only if you do so up to 35 days after the initial deletion date.<\/p>\n<p>As you know, you are not limited to just one account on GA4 &#8211; you can have multiple accounts at once if you want. Therefore, if you initially want to delete a complete GA account, but then want to restore it, you can log in to your GA account, go to the Trash Can, and restore it.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your location, the <em>Trash Can might be referred to as Rubbish Bin.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Monthly data backups will be deleted after 84 days<\/strong>. The Trash Can helps website owners to access website data during this time frame in case it is necessary to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about the GA Trash Can here.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"3-is-deleting-google-analytics-property-the-same-as-deleting-google-analytics-account\">3. Is Deleting Google Analytics Property the Same as Deleting Google Analytics Account?<\/h3>\n<p>No, deleting a GA Property and a GA Account is not the same thing. When you delete an account property, you are trashing each data stream, web view, and user access to certain <strong>Google Analytics Properties.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can still keep multiple properties with multiple views at the same time, so nothing \u201cdrastic\u201d will happen if you, as a website owner, decide to delete just one Google Analytics property.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>deleting a Google Analytics Account will delete absolutely everything:<\/strong> user access, properties, data stream, and all the views related to it.<\/p>\n<p>As it happens with GA account deletion, deleted properties will <strong>pass through the Trash Can<\/strong> before getting entirely deleted. The only difference is that monthly data backups will be deleted after 35 days instead of 84.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-delete-google-analytics-property\">How To Delete Google Analytics Property<\/h2>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to delete your entire GA data just yet, then you can <strong>simply delete individual properties.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All your properties will be shown inside the Admin Section of GA4, specifically, in the Property Column.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that only users who have at least <strong>Editor Role<\/strong> can delete Google Analytics properties.<\/p>\n<p>In order to assign editor roles, go to the Manage Users option using a proper account (admin account) and assign roles accordingly.
