Essentially, an engaged session is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A page view session that lasted <strong>10 seconds or longer<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>A session that triggered at least <strong>1 conversion event.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>A session that has <strong>2 or more page views<\/strong> per session.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These are all considered engaged sessions and count towards engagement rate and other metrics implemented by Google in <strong>GA4.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>In Universal Analytics, engagement on website was measured by bounce rate.<\/strong> Bounce rate is the percentage of sessions on a given page in which there were no interactions with that page.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a user visited a page on your website, but left the page without taking an action (like clicking a link), then that session will count towards the bounce rate.<\/p>\n<p>Per definition, <strong>bounce rate is the inverse of engagement rate:<\/strong> bounce rate is calculated based on non-engaged sessions, and engagement rate is calculated based on engaged sessions.<\/p>\n<p>There are other website\u2019s engagement metrics introduced by Google that we need take into account:<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Name<\/th>\n<th>Description<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Engaged Session<\/td>\n<td>Engagement Sessions take place when pageviews last more than 10 seconds, users visit other pages on your site, or they trigger conversion events.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Engaged Sessions Per User<\/td>\n<td>Engaged Sessions Per User is the overall number of engagement sessions that users have on your website on average over a certain time period.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Engagement Time<\/td>\n<td>Average Engagement Time is the average session duration of an engaged session on your site.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Engagement Rate<\/td>\n<td>Average engagement rate data is calculated based on user engagement actions on your website (long visits, clicks, events, and more).<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>You can see these different engagement rate metrics by checking the <strong>Engagement Overview<\/strong> on your Google Analytics 4 panel.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tracktrendyv2.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/engagement-rate-google-analytics-4-engagement-overview-usefathom.com_.jpg\" alt=\"engagement overview section\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"how-ga4-calculates-engagement-rate\">How GA4 Calculates Engagement Rate?<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>engagement rate formula<\/strong> implemented by Google is the following:<\/p>\n<p>Engagement rate = Number of Engaged Sessions \/ Total Number of Sessions * 100.<\/p>\n<p>By calculating the total number of engaged sessions and dividing it by total sessions (engaged or not), GA4 calculates your website\u2019s engagement rate expressed in percentages.<\/p>\n<p>If you had 15,000 total sessions on a website page, and 800 of those sessions engaged with your site, then your engagement rate would be:<\/p>\n<p>(800 \/ 15,000) * 100 = <strong>5.3%.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what-impacts-engagement-rate\">What Impacts Engagement Rate?<\/h2>\n<p>Engagement rate is impacted by the percentage of users who interact with a web page. If users <em>do not find the page useful<\/em>, they will leave without triggering events (remember that <strong>GA4\u2019s data model is event-based<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p>When looking at your engagement rate, you should focus on how this metric can help you in the following factors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>See the efficiency of a traffic source:<\/strong> are users who open your site from Facebook engaging with your site more than users from search engines?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Analyze marketing campaigns:<\/strong> measuring user satisfaction through engagement rates can help you improve your current marketing efforts to increase user engagement and meet their expectations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improve conversion rates:<\/strong> since engagement rate is also determined by events triggered (conversions), it is possible to use this information to identify opportunities that can lead to a high engagement rate. In general, high engagement rates lead to more overall conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-good-engagement-rate\">What is a Good Engagement Rate?<\/h2>\n<p>Multiple industries will have <strong>different definitions of good and bad engagement rates.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Hootsuite, experts agree that a good engagement rate is between 1% and 5% on most <em>social media platforms<\/em>. This can be considered a low engagement rate in different industries.<\/p>\n<p>On websites and online businesses, on average, <strong>a good engagement rate is somewhere between 60% and 70%.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, to answer this question: <strong>It depends.<\/strong> &#8220;Good&#8221; engagement rate varies based on the nature of the product or service, the ultimate business goals, the industry type, and the target audience.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to <strong>analyze, comprehend and interpret engagement rate<\/strong> and other engagement metrics to craft a custom strategy that can positively impact user engagement on your website.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"where-do-i-find-engagement-rate-in-ga4\">Where Do I Find Engagement Rate in GA4?<\/h2>\n<p>Engagement rate metrics provide valuable information related to your website content.
